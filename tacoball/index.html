        Welcome to Tacoball, the classic game inspired by the nostalgic era of
        games. This game was created by a father and son duo who wanted to fight
        boredom without relying on complicated tutorials or internet
        connections.

        back to a simpler time. The unique game that lets you play by tilting
        your phone! With no levels or power-ups to worry about, the objective of
        the game is to keep the ball bouncing by using your phone's tilt feature
        to move the paddle back and forth.

        But that's not all! For even more convenience, Tacoball is also
        available on the <strong>Apple Watch</strong>, allowing you to play right on your wrist.
