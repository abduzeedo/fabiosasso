                        <p>As a Director of Product Design based in Oakland, California, I currently lead a team of designers at 
                            Uber, focusing on the AI efforts across Uber in addition to Core Services and Enterprise (Uber for Business and Merchant tools). My goal is to help <strong>reimagine 
                                the way the world moves for the better.</strong></p> 

                        <p>Previously, I headed design for the <a href="https://developers.google.com/cars/design">Android Automotive 
                            Operating System, Google Automotive Services (GAS), and the Android Auto</a> phone projection product. 
                            During my 13 years at Google, I worked on a variety of 
                            innovative projects, from designing Google Doodles to supporting startups through Google Ventures, 
                            and developing new products for Shopping Express Mobile. I also led the vision for major products such as 
                            Google Search, Google Pay, Google Shopping, Google Play Music, and Google Play’s gaming efforts.</p>


                            <p>In my free time (if I ever find any!), I’m the mastermind behind <a href="https://abduzeedo.com/">Abduzeedo</a>, an award-winning digital 
                                publication dedicated to design. What began as a personal project has grown into a source of inspiration 
                                for millions of designers and enthusiasts worldwide. Additionally, I created <a href="https://calmaria.app/">Calmaria</a>, an app that helps 
                                people find peace of mind through simple breathing exercises—like therapy, but cheaper!
                            </p>

                            at Google and I've had the opportunity to work on some pretty wild projects - from designing Google Doodles to 
                            helping startups through Google Ventures, to building new products for Shopping Express Mobile. I've also been 
                            lucky enough to lead the vision for major products like Google Search, Google Pay, Google Shopping, Google Play
