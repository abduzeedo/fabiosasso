          <h2>Calmaria</h2>
          <p>I am the creator of Calmaria, a breathing app designed to bring peace of mind and tranquility to your daily life. The word "calmaria" is a Portuguese term meaning calmness, tranquility, and calm. It is often used by seamen and surfers to indicate that there are no waves in the ocean. This concept perfectly translates to the intention of my app - to help you relax and find tranquility amidst the chaos of daily life. Simply take a few deep breaths and let Calmaria guide you towards a more peaceful state of mind.
