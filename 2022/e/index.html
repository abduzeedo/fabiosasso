            I've been leading teams to create successful products by <span>developing multi-year product strategies and overseeing all phases of UX design work</span>. From distilling research to prototyping, final spec design, and implementation. My goal is to understand business needs and translate that to high quality products. But my expertise goes beyond just the product. As a Design Lead, <span>I understand the importance of building relationships</span> with executive leaders and cross-functional partners to create a culture that prioritizes the user and aligns with business goals. For the past 7 years, I've managed high-performing UX teams by setting clear goals and objectives while balancing short-term development with long-term career growth.

          <a href="https://calmaria.app/">Calmaria</a> in Portuguese means calmness, tranquility, calm. It’s often used by
          seamen and surfers to indicate that there are no waves in the ocean.
          That mood perfectly translates to what this app intends to do, bring
          peace of mind and tranquility to your busy day to day life. Just
          breathe and relax.

        <h2>Terral</h2>
        <h3>Designer & developer</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://calmaria.app/terral/">Terral</a> is Portuguese for the offshore breeze that originates in
          mountain woods. Intended for use with our breathing app, Calmaria,
          Terral is a gender-neutral fragrance, flexible for layering or use on
          its own. For anyone needing stress-relief and tranquility, apply
          Terral lightly to pulse points as a gentle reminder to breathe in and
          take time for yourself.
