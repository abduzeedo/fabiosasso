          I have been working in the design industry for more than 20 years
          leading teams to create compelling products. As a product design I
          have been developing multi-year product strategy focused on user
          needs, leading and executing on all phases of the UX design work
          including distilling research, design ideation, prototyping, final
          spec design, and implementation. Additionally I believe that design
          goes beyond just the product, as a design lead it’s important to build
          relationships with executive leaders and cross-functional partners to
          create a culture that puts the user first and aligns with the
          business.

          Head the UX for Android Automotive OS. For the past 7 years I have
          been managing high performing UX teams at Google setting clear goals
          and objectives while balancing short-term development with long term
          career growth. Before that I lead product and visual design as
          individual contributor for products like Maps, Music, Play Games,
          Search, and Wallet.

          In Portuguese means calmness, tranquility. That's
          the main goal of this Android and iOS app I created to help people cope with anxiety and focus on their mental health.
