            I have  been working in the design industry for more than 20 years leading teams to create compelling products. As a product design lead my experience goes from developing multi-year product strategies focused on user needs to overseeing all phases of the UX design work including distilling research, design ideation, prototyping, final spec design, and implementation. All while advocating for product quality above anything else. Additionally I believe that design goes beyond just the product, as a design lead it’s important to build relationships with executive leaders and cross-functional partners to create a culture that puts the user first and aligns with the business. For the past 7 years I have been managing high performing UX teams setting clear goals and objectives while balancing short-term development with long term career growth.

          <a href="https://calmaria.app/">Calmaria</a> in Portuguese means calmness, tranquility, calm. It’s often used by
          seamen and surfers to indicate that there are no waves in the ocean.
          That mood perfectly translates to what this app intends to do, bring
          peace of mind and tranquility to your busy day to day life. Just
          breathe and relax.

        <h2>Terral</h2>
        <h3>Designer & developer</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://calmaria.app/terral/">Terral</a> is Portuguese for the offshore breeze that originates in
          mountain woods. Intended for use with our breathing app, Calmaria,
          Terral is a gender-neutral fragrance, flexible for layering or use on
          its own. For anyone needing stress-relief and tranquility, apply
          Terral lightly to pulse points as a gentle reminder to breathe in and
          take time for yourself.
