            I have been working in the design industry for more than 20 years
            leading teams to create compelling products. As a product design I
            have been developing multi-year product strategy focused on user
            needs, leading and executing on all phases of the UX design work
            including distilling research, design ideation, prototyping, final
            spec design, and implementation. Additionally I believe that design
            goes beyond just the product, as a design lead it’s important to
            build relationships with executive leaders and cross-functional
            partners to create a culture that puts the user first and aligns
            with the business.

          Head the UX for Android Automotive OS. For the past 7 years I have
          been managing high performing UX teams at Google setting clear goals
          and objectives while balancing short-term development with long term
          career growth. Before that I lead product and visual design as
          individual contributor for products like Maps, Music, Play Games,
          Search, and Wallet.

        <p>
          Calmaria in Portuguese means calmness, tranquility, calm. It’s often used by
          seamen and surfers to indicate that there are no waves in the ocean.
          That mood perfectly translates to what this app intends to do, bring
          peace of mind and tranquility to your busy day to day life. Just
          breathe and relax.

        <p>
          Terral is Portuguese for the offshore breeze that originates in
          mountain woods. Intended for use with our breathing app, Calmaria,
          Terral is a gender-neutral fragrance, flexible for layering or use on
          its own. For anyone needing stress-relief and tranquility, apply
          Terral lightly to pulse points as a gentle reminder to breathe in and
          take time for yourself.
